# Food Truck Project

## Details
This project allows you to enter in up to five food trucks along with the customer
ratings, names, and the type of food on the truck. Once you enter in the desired
number of food trucks you display all food trucks to compare the types of food and
ratings. It also allows you to see which food truck was the highest rated where
you can see the name of the truck, type of food it has and its customer satisfaction
rating. Finally it can access all the ratings stored in the array and average the data
and then the average will be displayed to the user.
## What I learned
I learned how to use for loops to increment, access data, and store data within an array. I learned how to create an array. I learned how to create objects within a class. I also learned
how to utilize various different loops in tandem to execute the Project properly.
## Technologies Used
