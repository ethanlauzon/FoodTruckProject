# Food Truck Project

## Details
This project allows you to enter in up to five food trucks along with the customer
ratings, names, and the type of food on the truck. Once you enter in the desired
number of food trucks you display all food trucks to compare the types of food and
ratings. It also allows you to see which food truck was the highest rated where
you can see the name of the truck, type of food it has and its rating. Finally it
can average out the ratings across all food trucks entered and will return an average
score.
